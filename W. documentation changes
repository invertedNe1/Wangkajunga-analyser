Documentation of changes to Wangkajunga texts (in my digitalisation of them)

* only first letter of abreviations remains capitalised eg. ERG -> Erg, ALL -> All

* elements joined with '+' (and not '-') in both directions
	eg. ya-rra-ya -> ya+rra+ya
	    go-NARPST-3plS -> go+NARPST+3plS

* pronoun clitics given an extra tag +Pron/Clt and broken into respectively two or three parts:
	eg. -3plS -> +Pron/Clt+3Pl+Subj
	eg. -1plexO -> +Pron/Clt+1Pl+Excl+Obj
  	* additionally, case names for these clitic parts are lengthened/adapted:
		S -> Subj
		O -> Abs (the "object" case is always absolutive, while "subject" can be either absolutive or ergative, depending on the transitivity of the verb)
		D -> Dat
	 	 -> Acs (accessory case can be locative or allative)
		  -> Refl
		ex -> +Excl
		   -> +Incl
	* Dual renamed from dl -> Du eg 3dlS -> +Pron/Clt+3Du+Subj

* verb tags changed: Except for present, other tense tags are split to explicitly say if a verb tense is imperfective or perfective.
	eg. ya-rra: go-NARPST -> go+Perf+PstNar
	eg. wanin-ma: cut-PSTIMP -> cut+Imperf+Past
	* some tag names altered:
		NARPST -> Perf+PstNar
		PSTIMP -> Imperf+Past
		PSTHB -> Imperf+PstHbt

* other tag changes:
	RDP -> Redpl
	POSS -> Gen
	NOM -> Nomz (verb nominalisation)
	A set of clitic particles given a longer tag:
	PROB -> Clt/Prob
	Derivative class of noun cases given longer names:
	eg. HAV -> Der/Hav
	eg. ASST -> Der/Asst
	Demonstrative-specific case endings similarly given longer tag name:
	eg. REL -> Dem/ngula
* words joined by dots separated.
	eg. Dolly.Snell (proper name) -> two entries: Dolly and Snell
	* same for translated words
		eg. minyuparnta: marsupial.mouse -> marsupial mouse
		 
* removed full stops and commas from the text

* word given as xx-rra (gloss "go+NARPST") changed accordingly (appropriately) to ya-rra 

* style effect removed; final vowel sometimes transcribed several times.
	eg. waka-laaaa -> waka-la

* some English or Kriol phrases are analysed together in the original, and here split up
	eg. last week (one entry) -> last /n week (two entries)
	* one 'compound' word represented with a dot: Roadboard.camp -> Road
	#TODO: can there be a hyphen / dot?

* phrase "not our roadhouse, another one" not given any analysis -> broken into individual English words with no affixes.

* words given base tag (+N for nouns, +TV/IV for verbs, +Interj for interjection, +Pron+Interr for interrogative pronouns. (this could be extended / given more detail)
#TODO: one word not analysed in 'gold standard'. layi:xx
#TODO: PST(K) on 'deibin' not analysable (remove?)

* some words with #TODOs from the texts, due to unseen grammatical features:
 kawaku as suffix "as.well"
 yiltakirliya #TODO: why can this start a word? one case of parra as well. Will this work in morph analyser?
 minyirrilaju # TODO: affix as stem?
 parrangulajura #TODO: affix as stem
 nalaju #TODO affix FOC as stem
 yungunypakanu #TODO: what is the correct analysis? Appears to be a compound noun
 layi given analysis xx
 suffix -nu given analysis ?: road.camp+pa+nu+laju #TODO: 1. why question mark? hyphen in road+camp
road.camp+Pa+?+Pron/Clt+1Pl+Excl+Subj
 watijunkutingu alternatively given analysis watijunku+V+TV+Act+Perf+Pst OR watijunku+V+TV+Irr+Act+Perf+Pst (the second of which won't generate in my analysis)
 for several compound verbs the compound is given a single entry. eg takurlju = takurl + ju

* notes on words which are incorrect, and why:
round 1 not verbs
 Redpl not working, Pa not working(!), Prs not working?? as.well not expected, 
 pujikatu appearing as pukikatu?
 palunyakurnungka	palunya+Dem+Gen+Loc	expected that Demonstrative can only have 1 semantic case (x2)
 tiltilja tiltil+N+Loc	cons + Loc = ja (not ngka); not working in twolc
 tilytilja - same as tiltilja
 board.u.lu - what is 'u'?
 kartiyatu - twolc not working for alt. erg form tu. Same Barrylu.
 yaun (not yanu)
 roadhouse-ngutu (nguru expected)
 jii-ngka-wu -> wu noted as EMPH, when expected VOC. Several expected EMPH forms, wu is not one of them. 
 ngayu-n-ja-lanya-juya - ja not alternative LOC form of ngka (as twolc not working)
 +N+Spat nouns unexpected alternative ablative form -mparni. Unexpected PERL semantic case
 pitingkangula. Ngula is given as relative with yangka - here somehow on noun piti (hole)
round 2 verbs
 kanyin-mana-ya. mana 'given' as PSTIMP, expected just ma.
 ngarrin. vowel-deletion not implemented in twolc -> ngarri +Prs is producing ngarri-in..
 ngarrinmapula. IMP+PSTHBT. expected would be ngarri-ma-pula x2
 nyakutimaraya. ti ACT has wrong flag (U.WA) should be different letter - now make it WA conj. can fix? think not.
 wakala. +Pron/Clt+3Pl+Subj - would expect 'la' not nothing
